# Conveyor Belt Simulator

This is a little coding challenge I received for one of the interviews that got me very interested in the aspect of computer science applied to solving real world industry problems.

Since time is very limited the project is being built slowly but surely.

The idea is to have a fully configurable conveyor belt simulator with some form of a visual output.

Most likely I will apply my newly gained knowledge of Flask/SqlAlchemy and React to create a full app out of this.

But at this moment in time pure Python has to do.
